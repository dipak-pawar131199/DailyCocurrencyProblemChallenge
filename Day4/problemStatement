🚀 Day 4 Challenge: Rate-Limited Worker Pool

🧩 Problem Statement
You have multiple tasks to process concurrently, but:
1) Only N workers can run at a time
2) Tasks must be processed at max X requests per second (rate limiting)
3) You must support graceful shutdown using context.Context
4) Processing operation :
  1. Simulate heavy processing using sleep (300–700 ms)
  2. Compute:
    result = n*n + 10
  3. Return:
    - original task
    - result
    - processing duration

Capture:
1) task result
2) task execution time
3) total processing time

📥 Input

tasks := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
workers := 3
rateLimit := 2 // tasks per second

📤 Expected Output (sample)
Worker 1 processed task 2 in 503ms
Worker 3 processed task 1 in 498ms
Worker 2 processed task 3 in 510ms
...
Total execution time: 5.2s


🧠 Hints
Use one ticker shared across all workers
Each worker should:
1) wait for ticker
2) read from task channel
3) respect ctx.Done()
5) Use sync.WaitGroup
6) Track execution time using time.Now()
