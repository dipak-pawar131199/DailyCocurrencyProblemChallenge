🚀 Golang Concurrency – Day5 Fan-In Pattern with Timeout & Processing Time

🧠 Concepts Covered
1) Multiple producer
2) Fan-In (many → one channel)
3) select with time.After
4) Context cancellation
5) Measuring per-task and total processing time
6) Safe channel closing

📌 Problem Statement:

1) You have 2 producers generating numbers concurrently.
2) Each producer:
  . Generates numbers from 1 to 10
  . Adds a random delay (100–500ms) before sending
3) A single consumer:
  . Receives values from both producers (fan-in)

5) Processes each number:
   result = n*n + 5

Prints:
 Producer ID
 Value
 Processing time per task
