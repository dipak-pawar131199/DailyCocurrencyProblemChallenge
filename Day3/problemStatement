🔥 Day 3 Cancelable Pipeline with Partial Results (Very Real-World)

🧠 Problem Statement

You are building a data processing pipeline with 3 stages:

1) Producer – generates numbers 1 → N
2) Processor – squares each number (simulate slow work)
3) Consumer – collects results

👉 BUT there is a twist:

1) If processing time exceeds a given timeout,
the whole pipeline must cancel immediately
2) Already processed results must still be printed
3) No goroutine leaks allowed


📌 Constraints

Use:
context.Context for cancellation
Goroutines + channels
Each processing step takes 200ms
Timeout = 700ms
N = 10

🎯 Expected Behavior

Processed: 1 -> 1
Processed: 2 -> 4
Processed: 3 -> 9
Processed: 4 -> 16
Pipeline cancelled due to timeout
(Exact count may vary slightly)
