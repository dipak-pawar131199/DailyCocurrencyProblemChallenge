🚀 Golang Concurrency – Day 6 Problem Statement
Pipeline Pattern with Fan-Out, Fan-In & Error Handling

📌 Scenario

You are building a data processing pipeline (think ETL / report generation).

Data flows through 3 stages:
Generator → Processor → Aggregator
🧩 Stage Details
Stage 1: Generator 
   1) Generates numbers from 1 to N
   2) Sends numbers to the pipeline
   3) Stops immediately if context is cancelled
Stage 2: Processor (Fan-Out)
   1) Runs M workers
     Each worker:
        Receives a number
        Simulates processing (200–500ms)
        If number is divisible by 7, treat it as an error
        Otherwise transforms:
        output = n*n
     Sends:
        Successful results to resultChan
        Errors to errorChan

Stage 3: Aggregator (Fan-In)
      Collects processed results

      Prints:
      Worker ID
      Input value
      Output value
      Processing time

Stops pipeline immediately if:
   Error count reaches K
   OR context is cancelled


⛔ Failure Rules

    If K errors occur:
    Cancel the context
    Stop generator and processors
    Drain remaining channels safely
    No goroutine leak
    No panic on closed channels
