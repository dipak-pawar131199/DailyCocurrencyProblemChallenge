🧠 Concurrency Challenge: Concurrent URL Status Checker
Problem Statement

You are given a list of URLs.
Your task is to check their HTTP status codes concurrently and return the results.

Requirements: 
1) Use goroutines to make concurrent HTTP requests
2) Use channels to collect results
3) Limit concurrency to N workers (worker pool pattern)
4) Handle timeouts properly
5) Preserve input order in the output


Input:

urls := []string{
    "https://google.com",
    "https://github.com",
    "https://invalid-url",
    "https://golang.org",
}

workers := 2


Expected output:
https://google.com  -> 200
https://github.com -> 200
https://invalid-url -> error
https://golang.org -> 200

(Output order must match input order)
