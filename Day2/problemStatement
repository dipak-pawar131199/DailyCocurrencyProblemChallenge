📌 Problem Statement: Concurrent muliplications of numbers

You are given N jobs (numbers).
Process them using a fixed number of workers and print the result.

Each job:
1) Takes time (simulate with time.Sleep)
2) Computes job * job

✅ Requirements
1) Use goroutines
2) Use channels
3) Use worker pool pattern
4) Use sync.WaitGroup
5) No goroutine leaks
6) Workers should exit gracefully

📝 Input
jobs := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
numWorkers := 3

🎯 Expected Output (order may vary):
Worker 1 processed job 2 → result 4
Worker 3 processed job 1 → result 1
Worker 2 processed job 3 → result 9
...
